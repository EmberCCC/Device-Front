## Key Features

- **Easy to use:** Seamless zooming and panning, single- and multi selection of graph elements and keyboard shortcuts are supported out of the box
- **Customizable:** Different [node](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/nodes/node-types) and [edge types](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/edges/edge-types) and support for custom nodes with multiple handles and custom edges
- **Fast rendering:** Only nodes that have changed are re-rendered and only those in the viewport are displayed
- **Hooks and Utils:** [Hooks](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/hooks/use-react-flow) for handling nodes, edges and the viewport and graph [helper functions](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/graph-util-functions)
- **Plugin Components:** [Background](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/plugin-components/background), [MiniMap](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/plugin-components/minimap) and [Controls](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/plugin-components/controls)
- **Reliable**: Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and tested with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Attribution

React Flow includes a small attribution that links to the React Flow website. Per default the attribution is displayed in the bottom right corner. With the attribution we want to achieve that companies who are using React Flow in commercial applications finance the development of the library.
We expect users who are using React Flow commercially to subscribe to React Flow Pro if they want to remove the attribution. In non-commercial applications you may hide the attribution without subscribing but are welcome to [sponsor us on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/wbkd).

## Installation

The easiest way to get the latest version of React Flow is to install it via npm:

```bash
npm install react-flow-renderer
```

## Quick Start

This is only a very basic usage example of React Flow. To see everything that is possible with the library, please refer to the [website](https://reactflow.dev) for [guides](https://reactflow.dev/docs/guides/custom-nodes), [examples](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/overview) and [API reference](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/react-flow-props).

```jsx
import ReactFlow, { MiniMap, Controls } from 'react-flow-renderer';

function Flow({ nodes, edges, onNodesChange, onEdgesChange, onConnect }) {
  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
      onConnect={onConnect}
    >
      <MiniMap />
      <Controls />
    </ReactFlow>
  );
}
```

Before you start you need to install the React Flow dependencies via `npm install` and the ones of the examples `cd example && npm install`.

If you want to contribute or develop custom features the easiest way is to start the dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

and the example app via:

```sh
cd example && npm start 
```

The example app serves the content of the `example` folder and watches changes inside the `src` folder. The examples are using the source of the `src` folder.

## Testing

Testing is done with cypress. You can find the tests in the [`integration/flow`](/cypress/integration/flow) folder. In order to run the tests do:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Credits

React Flow was initially developed for [datablocks](https://datablocks.pro), a graph-based editor for transforming, analyzing and visualizing data in your browser. Under the hood, React Flow depends on these great libraries:

* [d3-zoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom) - used for zoom, pan and drag interactions with the graph canvas
* [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable) - used for making the nodes draggable
* [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - internal state management
